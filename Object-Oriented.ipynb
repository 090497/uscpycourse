    "### About OO\n",
    "\n",
    "Object Oriented programming is a computing paradigm that stablish that a program is a composed with objects and the relations between them. Each object is a class, and it can change state along the program. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main advetange of OO code is that is very modular. Classes provides the users with a tool-box. It is like a *lego* game, you use the objects as pieces of *lego* to built your programs. \n",
    "The code is very reasuble. The main disaventage is that OO has well defined pieces, the classes, but it does not define the program. To understand how a program works you need to follow how the objects relate between themselves and change status along the program. Sometimes this is a *detectivesque* task. The pieces of the your computing program are well identifies (the classes), but the interaction between them (the structure, the program itself) it is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some computing problems that fit nicely into the OO programming. If you decide to structure your program using OO programming, you should analyize the different elements of your problem, what are its abstraction, how they relate. It requires a deep analyses before to start to write. OO forces you to deeply think in your conpyting problem!"

    "Each game will have now players. In almost all the games, at the start, the desk is shuffle and each player gets a number of cards, and the rest is placed on the table on the stock pile, some maybe dare displayed on the table face up. The game proceeds in tourns. At each tourn the player does a movement, either he takes one card from his hand and place on the table face up or on the pile of discarted cards, face down. In some games the player gets an score after playing his tourn, or at the end of the game. In others, the game ends with cards are exhausted or a condition is met. How we defined this in OO? We have a *Player* class, certainly. What else? We have seen that most of the interactions in the game are related with moving a card or cards from a pile to the hand of the player, to pile to pile, etc. The concept of pile and hand (the cards of a player) are similar, a set of cards. Let's named *CardSet*. Now when a player put a card from his hand to display it moves from his hand ( *CardSet*) to another, the display. \n"
