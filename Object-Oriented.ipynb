    "### About OO\n",
    "\n",
    "Object Oriented programming is a computing paradigm that stablish that a program is a composed with objects and the relations between them. Each object is an instance of a generic class, and it can change state along the program. \n",
    "\n",
    "The main adventage of OO code is that is very modular. Classes provides the users with a tool-box. It is like a *lego* game, you use the objects as pieces of *lego* to built your programs. \n",
    "OO code is very reasuble. It has well defined pieces, the classes, but it does not define the program. To understand how a program works you need to follow how the objects relate between themselves and change status along the program. Sometimes this is not an easy task! In OO the pieces of the your computing program are very well identifies (the classes), but the interaction between them (the structure, the program itself) it is not.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are some computing problems that fit nicely into the OO programming. If you decide to structure your program using OO programming, you should analyize the different elements of your problem, what are its abstraction, how they relate. It requires a deep analyses before to start to write. OO forces you to deeply think in your conpyting problem! Sometimes it can be desesperating! But we you find the 'structure' behind your program, you have the impression of 'seeing the light!'"

In the following we discuss the elements of a 'generic' card game, and later we implement a concrete game with a Spanish desk, my grand-mother favorite: 'El cinquillo' (she expended many afternoons playing it with her female friends in her small village in Aragon!)\n",

    "#### The desk\n",

    "Each game will have players. In almost all the games, at the start, the desk is shuffle and each player gets a number of cards, and the rest of the cards are placed on a stock pile, and maybe some cards are displayed on the table face up. A game usually proceeds in tourns. At each tourn, each player does a movement, either he takes one card from his hand and place on the table face up or on the pile of discarted cards, face down. In some games the player gets an score after playing his tourn. In others, the game ends with cards are exhausted or a condition is met. How we defined this in OO? We have a *Player* class, certainly. We have also the *Bank*, that holds the stock of the cards, the cards on display, and the discarted cards, depends on the game. All of them are set of cards, or *desks* of cards.\n",
    "\n",
    "We realize that most of the interactions in the game are related with moving a card or cards from a pile to the hand of the player to the discated pile, to pile to pile, etc. The concept of pile and hand (the cards of a player) are similar: a set of cards. Should we use *Desk* to define set of cards and create a full desk for the Spanish desk? Can we provide to *Desk* the methods to handle cards between *desks*? Let's see if it works:"
